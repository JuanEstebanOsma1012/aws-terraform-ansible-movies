# Example Terraform variables file
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and modify the values as needed
# Note: All variables have defaults in variables.tf, so you only need to override what you want to change

# AWS region where resources will be created
# region = "us-east-1"

# Database credentials (CHANGE THESE IN PRODUCTION!)
db_username = "your_db_user"
db_password = "YourSecurePassword123!"

# Uncomment and modify these optional variables as needed:
# environment = "production"
# project_name = "movie-analyst"
